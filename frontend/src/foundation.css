/* Global CSS for Default Border and Outline Color */

/*
   1. Set the base text color (which "currentColor" defaults to).
      This affects text, but also indirectly influences borders/outlines
      that are set to use currentColor.
*/
html {
  color: #2F3E46; /* This sets the default text color for the entire document */
}

/*
   2. Ensure explicit outline color for all elements.
      The 'outline-color' property, if not specified, defaults to 'currentColor'.
      However, explicitly setting it here ensures that even if an element's
      text 'color' property is overridden later, its outline color will
      still default to #2F3E46.
      
      We use the universal selector to catch everything.
*/
* {
  outline-color: #2F3E46;
}

/*
   3. Target common elements that might have default browser borders
      or are likely to receive borders/outlines in your design.
      By setting 'border-color' here, any existing borders on these
      elements (or future ones you add) will inherit this color.
      
      Crucially, this *only* sets the color; it does not add a border
      if one isn't already present (i.e., if border-style and border-width
      are not defined).
